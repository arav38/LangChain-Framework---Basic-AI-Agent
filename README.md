# LangChain-Framework---Basic-AI-Agent


Hereâ€™s how your implementation currently functions based on the GitHub code:

ðŸ”¹ 1. User Input
The system takes free-form natural language input from the user.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Routing Logic
You use a custom decision logic (route_func) or LLM prompt to classify the query into one of the four types:

Wikipedia

Financial

Medical

Insurance

ðŸ”¹ 3. Tool-Based Execution
Based on classification, LangChain's Tool abstraction is used to run the appropriate function:

Wikipedia: Queries Wikipedia using LangChainâ€™s wrapper or wikipedia Python library.

Financial: Placeholder logic (can be extended using Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance APIs).

Medical/Insurance: Currently prints/logs messages but structured to support Retrieval-based pipelines.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Agent Execution
All tools are registered with an AgentExecutor (likely with initialize_agent or AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION) which decides which tool to use based on the query and executes it.



To make your agent production-grade or more advanced:

Integrate retrieval-based QA (e.g., RetrievalQA.from_chain_type) for Medical and Insurance data using:

FAISS or Chroma + embeddings

Uploaded PDFs or CSVs

Replace static financial logic with live data API (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance)

Use LangGraph to model agents as graph nodes with transitions

Add a Streamlit or Flask UI for interaction

Add logging and memory (e.g., ConversationBufferMemory) for context handling
